                    <p class="card-text-subtitle-allinfo">Earth's original Green Lantern and a founding member of the Justice Society of America, Alan Scott has been a trailblazer for over 80 years.
                            Alan Scott is the first to bear the name Green Lantern, wielding a ring that focuses a mystical green flame. He was one of the first to put on a cape, becoming a founding member of the Justice Society of America. As time passed and Alan aged, he evolved into a mentor and inspiration to generations of new superheroes. Recharging his ring through his magic lantern, Green Lantern made his emerald glow a sign of hope and source of inspiration for decades.
                            Across the multiverse, on Earth-2, another Alan Scott wields the green flame after a tragic loss. This Green Lantern is the avatar of the Green, the elemental force that controls all living growth on Earth and focuses his powers through a ring meant for his dead partner. No less powerful or compelling than his earlier counterpart, he glows green to banish evil and help restore a war-torn world to its former greatness.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text" id="post-subtitle-text">Unlike others who bear the name "Green Lantern," Alan Scott's power does not come from the Guardians of the Universe, but from the Starheart, a magical entity once imprisoned by the Guardians. The Starheart found its way to Earth, where in 1939, in the shape of a lantern, it saved Alan from a train wreck (the "accident" was actually sabotage by Dekker, his rival). At the Lantern's mental direction, Alan fashioned a ring from it that allowed him to tap the Starheart's great power. Perhaps influenced subconsciously by the Starheart's history, Alan adopted the identity of Green Lantern. Alan Scott left ferroviary enginery and became employed in Apex Broadcasting Company, as a way to get any news about criminal activities in first hand. There he knew Doiby Dickles, a cab driver who became his sidekick, and Irene Miller, his first love interest.</p>

After the war, as a broadcast executive in the late forties, Alan Scott had a flirtatious relationship with the costumed villainess the Harlequin (who unbeknownst to Alan, was secretly his secretary, Molly Mayne). Molly even admitted that her career as a "criminal" was just a ruse to get close to Green Lantern. The Harlequin eventually turned over a new leaf, becoming an undercover agent for the FBI. She left Alan's life without confessing her true identity or her real feelings.</p>

Circa 10 years after, The Reaper activities prompted Alan Scott to briefly emerge from retirement to confront him as Green Lantern. Vastly overpowered during an encounter between the two, the Reaper lashed out in a panic with his nunchaku and, by happenstance, struck Green Lantern, whose force-field was vulnerable to the wooden weapons. The Reaper fled and subsequently moved to Europe. Several years later, Superman's debut, followed by JLA's inspired the former JSAers to reactivate their heroic identities again, including Alan.</p>

He was unaware that she was actually Rose Canton (a.k.a. The Thorn), a schizophrenic but reformed enemy of the Flash. Alyx disappeared on their wedding night, starting a fire that led Alan to believe she had died. In fact, she survived and discovered that she was pregnant with twins. The children were born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and raised separately by adoptive families as Jennifer-Lynn Hayden and Todd Rice. Alyx was taken to the Amazons' Reformation Island.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text" id="post-subtitle-text">Jennie-Lynn and Todd, who developed superhuman powers as a result of their father's connection to the mystic Starheart, did not meet until adolescence, and set out to uncover the identities of their real parents. They adopted the costumed identities of Jade and Obsidian and confronted Alan about their parentage. And truly, Alan had no clue. Also during this time, he renewed his acquaintance with Molly and discovered her past as the Harlequin; the pair finally gave in to their longtime attraction. But Rose Canton also resurfaced. Just before her death, she revealed the circumstances of Jennie and Todd's births. Alan and Molly were married, but soon separated by the JSA's banishment to Limbo. They were reunited two years later when the Justice Society returned to Earth.</p>

Some time after, he became employed at WXYZ Radio Station.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text" id="post-subtitle-text">At one point in recent years the Starheart made Alan appear much younger, and he took the new name and costume, Sentinel.[11] He encountered a mysterious new Harlequin (IV), who may have been a manifestation of the Starheart, which became malevolent. The Starheart was apparently destroyed and Alan's powers were diminished and he returned to his original uniform. Jade also lost her powers during this incident.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text" id="post-subtitle-text">When the Justice Society reformed, Alan was there as always to anchor the team. One of their first major cases pitted Sentinel against his son, Obsidian, who had been seduced by dark forces. Alan was forced to beat Todd into retreat. It soon became obvious (and was confirmed by Dr. Mid-Nite) that Alan had become the living embodiment of the Starheart. Any changes to his age or powers are merely psychosomatic. Obsidian returned in alliance with Mordru and Eclipso. This time, Alan set things right and banished Todd's dark powers, perhaps for good. After this, Alan reclaimed the name Green Lantern. Todd was taken into D.E.O. custody and vowed to atone for his actions. The recent events involving his son have made Alan somewhat overbearing and overprotective of the JSA's other "children."</p>

                                    <h2 class="card-title h4" id="post-title-text">Infinite Crisis</h2>
                                    <p class="card-text" id="post-subtitle-text">During the great Crisis created by Alexander Luthor and Superboy-Prime, Alan and Jade followed Donna Troy into space to investigate a cosmic rift. When Luthor was defeated, the rift began collapsing and Jennie-Lynn was caught in one of the shock waves. Alan was on Thanagar when she lost her life. He learned afterwards that as she died, she returned the power once given to her by Kyle Rayner. Thus in a way, she continues to live on within Rayner.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text" id="post-subtitle-text">When the rift collapsed for good, Alan and the remaining heroes were sent reeling through space and time. He and several others reemerged a week later on Earth. Alan was among the lucky ones, having only lost an eye. Alan then somehow gained Adam's right eye and lost his left eye completely.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text" id="post-subtitle-text">His missing eye was later replaced by a portion of his daughter Jade's mystic green energy. After being put into a comatose state during an attack by the Gentleman Ghost, Jade appeared to him, told him goodbye and granted him another portion of her green energy. His missing eye is currently replaced by a green glowing orb that, due to its mystical origins and connection to Jade, allows him to track astral and mystical energy forms such as ghosts.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text" id="post-subtitle-text">The JSA had also become a spectre of its former self, and its members became disillusioned about the team's effectiveness. This was underscored by the advent of Lex Luthor's Everyman technology, which awarded powers to a girl who adopted Jade's codename. Alan had to restrain Obsidian from accosting the girl.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text" id="post-subtitle-text">Soon Alan was approached by the spy organization Checkmate, which was reorganizing under U.N. control. They invited Alan to become their White King, which he accepted. His time with Checkmate was brief.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text" id="post-subtitle-text">Scott soon found himself in a moral conflict with Checkmate's Black Knight Sasha Bordeaux over the violent nature of Checkmate, particularly after Bordeaux and her team slaughtered dozens of Kobra operatives during a raid on a facility. Bordeaux contended that the ends justified the means, while Scott adhered to the principle that heroes should not kill unless absolutely necessary; Bordeaux responded to this by suggesting that Scott should resign. Concurrent with this internal conflict, Scott and "White Queen" Amanda Waller attempted to keep the organization from being discontinued by political forces.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text" id="post-subtitle-text">Another JSA member, Mr. Terrific, succeeded him in the post.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text" id="post-subtitle-text">Meanwhile, Alan was urged by the Justice League to re-establish the JSA as an organization that cares for the legacy of its heroes. When his time with Checkmate came to an end, Alan resumed an active role in the JSA.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text" id="post-subtitle-text">During the Blackest Night, Alan and the rest of the JSA appear in specifically battling the reanimated Kal-L and Black Lantern versions of dead Justice Society members. After Jakeem Thunder is knocked out, Alan is one of the heroes who combines his powers into a "Black Lantern Bomb" designed to mimic Jakeem's Thunderbolt abilities, destroying all of the Black Lanterns in New York.[12] In the final battle of the event, his daughter Jade is resurrected by the power of white light.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text" id="post-subtitle-text">Alan is shown in the arms of Obsidian, convulsing and writhing as a green light pours from his body.[14] His body possessed, Alan flies off with his JSA teammates in hot pursuit, a chase which eventually leads to Germany. In Germany, the JSA meet up with Batman's new Justice League, and find that Jade (who had been staying on Oa since her resurrection), has returned to Earth inside of a green meteor, which is revealed to be the legendary Starheart that gave Alan his powers. Sebastian Faust tells the two teams that the Starheart has been gradually taking control of people on Earth for quite some time, and now that it is on Earth, it is growing more powerful and driving metahumans all over the world insane. Jade states that the Starheart captured her in space and purposely brought her to Earth to find Alan, and also states that it is her fault that her father is now in danger. Just then, Alan awakens and his costume transforms into his suit of armor from Kingdom Come, and he then tells the assembled heroes that he intends on destroying the world.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text" id="post-subtitle-text">Starman is sent into space to search for Alan, and finds that the he has constructed a massive fortress on the surface of the moon. Before Starman can warn the others, Alan appears in front of him, and tears his gem (the source of his abilities) from his chest, thus rendering him powerless.[16] The Starheart begins using its influence to corrupt various metahumans with magical or elemental abilities, which creates chaos across the globe. Realizing that the heroes must defeat Alan in order to put an end to the madness taking hold of the earth, Batman recruits Miss Martian in order to get a mental lock on Starman, which in turn provides the Justice League with Alan's location. Batman then assembles a small strikeforce consisting of himself, Jade, Hourman, Donna Troy, Jesse Quick and Mr. America, all of whom have a low chance of being possessed by the Starheart. Mister Miracle arrives and informs the team that Alan has most likely installed Fourth World defenses in his base, and offers to use his knowledge of such technology to guide them through the fortress. Jade uses her powers to restore Alan to normal. With his sanity restored, Alan chooses to allow the Emerald City he created on the moon to stay, and eventually the city becomes populated by various magical creatures from throughout the DCU.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text" id="post-subtitle-text">After the event of the Brightest Day, Alan and the rest of the JSA travel to the city of Monument Point after it is attacked by a superpowered terrorist named Scythe. Just before being defeated, Scythe snaps Alan's neck. In the subsequent story, it is revealed that Scythe is the product of Nazi genetic engineering, and that Alan and Jay had been tasked by the president with killing the experiment back when he was in infant during World War 2. The two heroes could not agree on a course of action, and as a result Scythe was allowed to live. Doctor Mid-Nite discovers that the injuries Alan sustained have rendered him paralyzed, and that any attempt to heal himself could break his constant concentration, which could result in the Starheart once again regaining control of his body.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text" id="post-subtitle-text">Jade eventually visits her bed-ridden father in the Emerald City, and offers to use her abilities to help him walk again. Alan declines his daughter's offer, reasoning that if the Starheart were to once again take over his body, it could result in the deaths of everyone in the city. Eclipso eventually attacks the city, which results in Jesse Quick having to get Alan to safety.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text" id="post-subtitle-text">Alan eventually constructed a suit of armor from the Starheart energy which acted as an exoskeleton and gave him back a degree of mobility. He seemingly dissipated, however, after releasing the full power of the Starheart to seemingly destroy the fallen god called D'Arken. The JSA buried an empty coffin.</p>
